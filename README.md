## 📚 What I Learned During This Project

- This simple yet powerful app served as an excellent playground for practicing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

- I gained valuable experience in working with various HTTP methods like GET, POST, CREATE, and DELETE when making API calls.

## 🔄 The Challenge And The Solution:

- One of the exciting challenges I encountered was implementing nested reply messages functionality.
- To address this challenge, I had to devise a solution that allowed a component to call itself when rendering a nested reply. This recursive approach was key to achieving the desired functionality.
